# DisableParallelLoader

Simple plugin to disable the [parallel loading](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2017/10/windows-10-parallel-loading-breakdown) functionality of Windows. This makes it easier to understand what's going on during process creation.

You can download the plugin from the [releases](https://github.com/mrexodia/DisableParallelLoader/releases/latest).
